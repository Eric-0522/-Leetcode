## 題目說明
- There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for 1 <= i < n, and moving clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend.
- The rules of the game are as follows:
    1. Start at the 1st friend.
    2. Count the next k friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.
    3. The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.
    4. If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step 2 starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.
    5. Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.
- Given the number of friends, n, and an integer k, return the winner of the game.

- Input: n = 5, k = 2，Output: 3
- Explanation: Here are the steps of the game:
1) Start at friend 1.
2) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 1 and 2.
3) Friend 2 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.
4) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 4.
5) Friend 4 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 5.
6) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 5 and 1.
7) Friend 1 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.
8) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 5.
9) Friend 5 leaves the circle. Only friend 3 is left, so they are the winner.

## 解題說明
- 此題其實就是在解決[約瑟夫問題](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem)，要求你回傳最後一個存活下來的人(編號)是誰。
- 因此我嘗試用queue來解決此問題。
## 程式碼
```
class Solution {
public:
    int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        queue<int> qu;
        int i=1;
        while(i <= n) // 建立圓環
        {
            qu.push(i);
            i++;
        }
        while(qu.size() != 1)
        {
            int count = 1;
            while(count < k)
            {
                int temp = qu.front(); // 先將第一個值取出來
                qu.push(temp); // 再將此值放入queue中
                qu.pop(); // 將queue中最上面的值刪除
                count++;
            }
            qu.pop(); // 刪除下一個值
        }
        return qu.front();
    }
};
```
